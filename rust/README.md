# Bismark Rust rewrite

Active rewrite of Bismark from Perl to Rust. Progress is tracked at
the [Bismark Rust rewrite project](https://github.com/users/FelixKrueger/projects/1).

Working branch: [`rust/iron-chancellor`](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/tree/rust/iron-chancellor).

## Layout

- `bismark-io/` — shared library: BAM/SAM/CRAM I/O via [noodles](https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles). See `bismark-io/DESIGN.md` for the design contract.
- Per-binary crates are added incrementally (`bismark-dedup/`, `bismark-bedgraph/`, `bismark-extractor/`, …). Phase 1 priorities are tracked on the project board.

## Binary naming during coexistence

Rust binaries take an `_rs` suffix through approximately v0.26 → v1.0 so they can be installed alongside the Perl Bismark scripts on the same PATH without conflicts:

| Perl                            | Rust binary (during coexistence) |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `deduplicate_bismark`           | `deduplicate_bismark_rs`         |
| `bismark_methylation_extractor` | `bismark_methylation_extractor_rs` |
| `bismark2bedGraph`              | `bismark2bedGraph_rs`            |
| `coverage2cytosine`             | `coverage2cytosine_rs`           |

After v1.0 of the Rust port, the `_rs` suffix is dropped — the Rust binaries become the default `deduplicate_bismark` etc., and the Perl scripts move to a `legacy/` directory.

**Inside the published container image** the tools are *additionally* exposed under their **canonical names** (`bismark`, `deduplicate_bismark`, `coverage2cytosine`, …): a container has no Perl Bismark to collide with, so canonical names make it a drop-in for pipelines that call the tools by name (e.g. nf-core/methylseq). The `bismark` canonical name is a thin wrapper that answers `-v`/`--version` with a `Bismark v0.25.1`-compatible banner (so the pipeline's version capture is byte-identical to the Perl oracle) and otherwise execs `bismark_rs`; the rest are symlinks. Host installs keep the `_rs` suffix for Perl coexistence.

## Architecture decisions

- **BAM/SAM/CRAM I/O via pure-Rust `noodles`** — no `rust-htslib` (no htslib C build-time dep), no `samtools` subprocess (no external runtime dep).
- **One cargo workspace** with a binary crate per Bismark tool plus the shared `bismark-io` library. Library+binary split per crate so pure logic is unit-testable.
- **Byte-equal output to Perl Bismark v0.25.1** is a CI gate for the tools we have validated.
- Edition 2024; MSRV pinned in the workspace manifest.

## Installing

<!-- Maintainer: on a suite-version bump, update every `2.0.0-beta.3` / `beta.3` literal in this
     section (the pinned `docker pull` tag + the `cargo install --tag`), `suite_tag` in `rust/justfile`,
     AND the matching section in the docs site (`docs/src/content/docs/installation.md`).
     The `--branch` command and the prebuilt/container `:beta` paths track latest automatically. -->

Three ways to get the suite, easiest first — pick **one**.

### 1. Prebuilt binaries (no Rust toolchain needed)

Each [release](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/releases) attaches prebuilt binaries for common Linux/macOS platforms. Download the archive for your platform, extract it, and put the binaries on your `PATH`. The Rust tools carry an `_rs` suffix (see [Binary naming during coexistence](#binary-naming-during-coexistence)).

### 2. Container image (nothing to install)

A multi-arch image is published to the GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/felixkrueger/bismark:beta          # latest beta
docker pull ghcr.io/felixkrueger/bismark:2.0.0-beta.3  # pinned
```

Inside the container the tools are *additionally* exposed under their **canonical** names (`bismark`, `deduplicate_bismark`, …), so it is a drop-in for pipelines such as nf-core/methylseq.

### 3. Build from source with `cargo install` (whole suite, one command)

Requires a Rust toolchain (see Prerequisites below). This installs **all 12** binaries into `~/.cargo/bin` in a single invocation:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark \
  --tag bismark-rust-v2.0.0-beta.3 --locked \
  bismark-genome-preparation bismark-aligner bismark-dedup bismark-extractor \
  bismark-bedgraph bismark-coverage2cytosine bismark-methylation-consistency \
  bismark-nome-filtering bismark-filter-nonconversion bismark-bam2nuc \
  bismark-report bismark-summary
```

For the latest development build instead of a pinned release, swap `--tag bismark-rust-v2.0.0-beta.3` for `--branch rust/iron-chancellor`.

> **Updating.** Re-run the **`--branch`** command and cargo picks up the newest commit automatically (it prints `Replacing …`). **Re-running the same `--tag` is a no-op** — cargo reports the package is already installed. To move to a newer release, bump the `--tag` to the new version (e.g. `…beta.4`), or add `--force` to reinstall in place.

Compiling 12 crates from source is a non-trivial one-time build; cargo does not fully share dependency compilation across the listed packages.

#### Prerequisites (cargo path)

- **Rust** — latest stable recommended (`rustup update`). The workspace MSRV is **1.89**; the one-command install above was verified on **cargo 1.95** (older cargo may not resolve packages inside the `rust/` subdirectory).
- A working **C linker** (`cc`) for a few transitive build dependencies.
- **Alignment backends on `PATH`** — only the aligner and genome-preparation tools shell out to an external program: **Bowtie 2** + `bowtie2-build` (default), or optionally **HISAT2** + `hisat2-build`, or **minimap2**. `cargo install` builds the Rust tools, not these backends. *(No `samtools` is required — BAM/SAM I/O is pure-Rust `noodles`.)*
- Ensure **`~/.cargo/bin` is on your `PATH`** to run the installed `*_rs` binaries.

## Building

```bash
cd rust
cargo build --release
```

## Status

One headline per module — current state at a glance. Per-crate detail lives in each crate's `README.md` / `CHANGELOG.md`; the dated shipping log is under [Milestones](#milestones). Rows are in rough pipeline order. State key: ✅ shipped on `rust/iron-chancellor` · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ planned.

Versions are the crate manifests on `rust/iron-chancellor` (a release **git tag** such as `…beta.2` may lead its manifest version). "Byte-identical" = validated against Perl Bismark v0.25.1 per each crate's README/CHANGELOG + golden/real-data tests; speedups are full-scale where measured. `bismark-io` and `bismark-dedup` have early beta lines published to crates.io; later betas are queued for the next publish window.

> **Keeping this journal current:** every module-merge PR into `rust/iron-chancellor` should update that tool's row above **and** add a dated line to [Milestones](#milestones). The helper scripts (`copy_bismark_files_for_release.pl`, the `merge_*coverage*` Python utilities) are out of scope for the Rust port.

## Milestones

Reverse-chronological log of the main Rust-rewrite shipping events (merges into `rust/iron-chancellor`). One headline per event; per-crate detail is in the crate READMEs/CHANGELOGs.

- **2026-06-11** — `bismark` aligner **v2.x `--combined_index` paired-end NON-DIRECTIONAL mode** (combined-index v2.x Phase 3, #970) — extends the PE combined-index path to non-directional (parallel **model (a)**): **two** both-strands PE passes over `BS_combined` (C→T reads → OT/OB, G→A reads → CTOT/CTOB), `-k 2` each, **unioned per read pair** via the **reused** 4-slot `select_core_pe` tie machine (`[0,3,1,2]` scan order) + the byte-frozen `route_pe_decision` (both unchanged from Phase 2 — the directional phase front-loaded the 4-slot correctness, locked by `select_core_pe_uses_literal_scan_order_not_ascending`). New `select_pe_nondir` + two-stream driver (`drive_merge_combined_pe_nondir`, desync guard keyed on `SamPair::seq_id`) mirror the SE non-dir path doubled. Opt-in, never-silent, **concordance-gated (NOT byte-identical)**; PE pbat/HISAT2 + the single-pass/sequential low-RAM exec models stay rejected (later phases). **oxy gate PASS** vs the faithful 4-instance non-dir PE oracle (1M Sherman non-dir PE): **FLAG-pair/`XM`-pair 0-mismatch** on 950,673 POS-concordant pairs (incl. the new CTOT/CTOB); **MAPQ≥23 truth-accuracy ≈ oracle** (combined 99.78%/99.47% vs 99.98%/99.97% chr/within-fragment); churn 0.206% in the self-flagging MAPQ<23 multimapper tail. **Peak RSS 15.71 GB / 2 `bowtie2-align` co-resident (model (a) two-index signature) — the Phase-6 data-gate input** (a PE sequential variant would cut ~−50%, as the SE one did). The faithful default + all SE + Phase-2-directional combined paths untouched.
- **2026-06-11** — `bismark` aligner **v2.x `--combined_index` paired-end directional mode** (combined-index v2.x Phase 2, #969) — extends the combined-index path to **paired-end** (directional, Bowtie 2): ONE both-strands `-1/-2` pass over `BS_combined` (`-k 2`, `Orientation::Both`) instead of two strand-restricted PE instances, classified **per pair on read-1's orientation × sub-genome** into the byte-frozen PE output arm via a new PE slot map (`to_index_pe`: OT=0/CTOB=1/CTOT=2/**OB=3** — the OB↔CTOB 1↔3 swap vs the SE numbering), best-by-**summed-AS** with the shared `select_core_pe` tie machine (literal `[0,3,1,2]` scan order). `route_pe_decision` extracted from the faithful `drive_merge_pe` (pure relocation, reused by both drivers). Opt-in, never-silent, **concordance-gated (NOT byte-identical)**; non-dir/pbat/HISAT2/minimap2/multicore PE combined stay hard-rejected. **oxy gate PASS** vs the faithful 2-instance directional PE oracle (1M real WGBS PE + 1M clean Sherman PE): **FLAG-pair/`XM`-pair 0-mismatch** on ~850k/~950k POS-concordant pairs; **MAPQ≥23 truth-accuracy ≈ oracle** (combined 99.78%/99.46% vs 99.98%/99.97% chr/within-fragment); churn 0.21%(Sherman)/0.46%(real) is inherent to PE + concentrated in the self-flagging MAPQ<23 multimapper tail. The faithful default + all SE combined paths untouched. Phases 3 (PE non-dir) / 4 (PE pbat) / 5 (PE-HISAT2) next.
- **2026-06-09** — **`bismark-rust-v2.0.0-beta.3` released — nf-core/methylseq drop-in compatibility** — closes the 3 gaps an end-to-end **nf-core/methylseq 4.2.0** proof run exposed (output-byte-identity tests couldn't find these — only running the real pipeline did): the container now ships **`procps`** (Nextflow's task wrapper shells out to `ps` for every task's metrics), the **aligner accepts `--bam`** (the Perl flag methylseq passes; the modernized CLI had dropped it for BAM-default — re-added as an accepted no-op), and **`coverage2cytosine` accepts `--genome`** (alias of `--genome_folder`, which Perl took via Getopt prefix-match). With these, the beta is a **proven byte-identical drop-in for methylseq**: a `withName:'.*BISMARK_.*' { container = … }` swap yields **20/20 identical** methylation outputs (dedup BAM records / `.cov` / `.bedGraph` / CpG-report / M-bias) + identical genome-prep + splitting-report data vs the stock Perl `bismark:0.25.1` container, across 4 samples. No methylation/alignment logic changed (CLI + container only).
- **2026-06-09** — **`bismark-rust-v2.0.0-beta.2` released** — second public beta of the Rust suite (multi-arch GHCR image `ghcr.io/felixkrueger/bismark:beta`/`:2.0.0-beta.2` + 3 platform tarballs, all 12 tools). Delta since beta.1 (2026-06-06): the **v2 `--combined_index` epic** (directional / non-dir model (a) / pbat / single-pass model (b) / **sequential**, #955–959) + the **canonical-name container** (#960) — a zero-edit nf-core/methylseq drop-in (tools exposed under canonical names; `bismark -v` byte-identical to the Perl v0.25.1 version oracle). All 12 suite tools remain byte-identical to Perl v0.25.1.
- **2026-06-08** — `bismark` aligner **v2 `--combined_index_sequential` — faithful sequential non-directional memory mode** (#959) — the **faithful** counterpart to model (b) (#958): runs model (a)'s two both-strands non-dir passes **SEQUENTIALLY** — pass 1 (C→T) spills its records to a temp file and its Bowtie 2 **exits** (freeing the combined index) before pass 2 (G→A) spawns — replaying pass 1 from disk via a new file-backed `SamStream` (`FileSamStream`) and unioning per read via the EXISTING `combined::select_nondir`. **One combined index resident at a time → −50% peak RSS**, the same memory win as model (b) but **BYTE-IDENTICAL** to the default parallel model (a): Bowtie 2's output is independent of *when* each pass runs (exec-model spike control C2) and both feed the same UNTAGGED converted files → it **inherits model (a)'s validation** (no Sherman accuracy gate needed). `drive_merge_combined_nondir` reused with a body-unchanged, **signature-only** generic widening (`<S>`→`<C, G>`); `merge.rs`/`methylation.rs`/`output.rs`/`combined.rs` + the model (a)/(b)/directional/pbat paths byte-unchanged. Opt-in, never-silent, **mutually exclusive with `--combined_index_single_pass`**. **oxy gate PASS** (1M Sherman, both modes from one binary): BAM records byte-identical to model (a) (**929,141 recs, same md5**; unmapped + ambiguous identical) + **RSS 7.82 GB / 1 `bowtie2-align-l` vs model (a) 15.70 GB / 2** (ratio 0.498); wall 1.97× (passes serial — the trade). Sequential's 7.82 GB == model (b)'s, but faithful. **Completes the combined-index v2 epic** (all 3 SE library types + both memory modes — non-faithful model (b) + faithful sequential). **NON-DIR ONLY**. rammap / avenue-B remain deferred.
- **2026-06-08** — `bismark` aligner **v2 `--combined_index_single_pass` — non-directional model (b) single-pass memory mode** (#958) — an opt-in single-pass execution model for `--combined_index --non_directional`: ONE Bowtie 2 pass over conversion-TAGGED interleaved reads (`<id>__CT` C→T + `<id>__GA` G→A) over `BS_combined`, split by the qname tag back into the C→T (OT/OB) + G→A (CTOT/CTOB) groups and fed to the EXISTING `combined::select_nondir` union — **one combined index load instead of model (a)'s two (−50% peak RSS)**. **NOT byte-identical AND NOT decision-equivalent** to model (a): the qname tag perturbs Bowtie 2's read-name-seeded RNG (~98/1M co-optimal reads pick differently — benign + symmetric) — so it is explicitly opt-in, never the default, never silently substituted, and ground-truth-validated on its own (the model-(b) accuracy spike). NEW `convert_se_tagged_interleaved` core (the frozen single-kind converters untouched) + a one-stream/split-by-tag driver; the shared per-read tail extracted to `select_and_route_se_nondir` (both model (a) + (b) drivers). **oxy gate PASS** (1M Sherman balanced reads): **RSS 7.82 GB / 1 `bowtie2-align-l` vs model (a) 15.70 GB / 2** (ratio 0.498 — machine-asserted co-residency, the silent-no-op guard); Sherman accuracy 99.9631% ≈ oracle 99.9663% (|Δ| 0.0032 pp); decision agree-rate vs model (a) 99.9958%; §4b same-pos-strand 0. `merge.rs`/`methylation.rs`/`output.rs`/`combined.rs` byte-unchanged; the faithful default + model (a) + directional/pbat paths untouched. **NON-DIR ONLY** (the sole 2-index-load mode). rammap / avenue-B remain deferred.
- **2026-06-08** — `bismark` aligner **v2 `--combined_index` PBAT mode shipped — avenue-A COMPLETE for all 3 SE library types** (#957) — extends the combined-index path to the **third and final SE library type**, completing avenue-A (directional #955 / non-directional #956 / pbat). PBAT-combined is the **G→A-pass half of non-directional, standalone**: ONE both-strands Bowtie 2 pass over `BS_combined` fed the G→A-converted reads, `-k 2`, classified to **CTOT (2) / CTOB (3)** via `classify(ReadConv::Ga,…)` and resolved by the shared `combined::select_core` tie machine (CTOB wins a same-locus CTOT×CTOB tie, later slot). Routes `route_se_decision(pbat=FALSE)` — `classify` emits index 2/3 directly, so the faithful `+2` modifier (`pbat=true`) would double-shift to eff 4/5 (fail-loud, never a silent miscall). The directional `drive_merge_combined`/`process_se_chunk_combined` were parametrized with a `SelectFn` fn-pointer (one shared gather loop; behaviour-identical for directional) rather than triplicated. **oxy `--pbat` gate PASS** vs the faithful 2-instance oracle (same binary, flag off) on 1M Sherman balanced reads, `-k 2`: oracle-unique-stays-unique 99.9557% (churn 0.0443%); **CTOT POS/`XM`/FLAG/`XR`/`XG` = 100%**, CTOB ≥99.99828% + =100% among POS+strand-concordant; **OT/OB empty (n=0)** — the PBAT signature; §4b same-pos-strand divergence 0; Sherman position accuracy combined 99.9546% ≈ oracle 99.9561% (|Δ| 0.0015 pp). `merge.rs`/`methylation.rs`/`output.rs` byte-unchanged; the faithful default + directional/non-dir combined paths untouched. Model (b) (single tagged invocation, the −50% RSS memory mode) shipped next (#958); rammap/avenue-B remain deferred.
- **2026-06-08** — `bismark` aligner **v2 `--combined_index` NON-DIRECTIONAL mode shipped** (#956) — extends the combined-index path (#955) to non-directional: **two** both-strands Bowtie 2 passes over `BS_combined` (C→T reads → OT/OB, G→A reads → CTOT/CTOB), `-k 2` each, **unioned per read**; read-conversion-aware classification + the shared `chr:pos`+`>=`+Sylvain-Foret tie machine (`combined::select_core`) across all four synthetic indices (OT=0/OB=1/CTOT=2/CTOB=3), **CTOB winning the §4b telomeric OT×CTOB same-position collision** (later slot). Model **(a)** (two parallel passes + per-read union); the single conversion-tagged-invocation model (b) was spike-rejected (the qname tag perturbs Bowtie 2's read-name-seeded RNG → not decision-equivalent) and deferred to v2.x. **oxy non-dir gate PASS** vs the faithful 4-instance oracle (same binary, flag off) on 1M Sherman balanced non-dir reads, `-k 2`: oracle-unique-stays-unique 99.978% (churn 0.022%); 4 strands balanced; per-strand exact-POS/`XM` ≥99.9987% (incl. the new CTOT/CTOB); `XR`/`XG`/FLAG ≥99.99% + =100% among POS-concordant; §4b same-pos-strand divergence 0; Sherman position accuracy combined 99.9639% ≈ oracle 99.9663% (|Δ| 0.0024 pp). **PBAT combined shipped next** (#957). The faithful default + the directional combined path are untouched.
- **2026-06-08** — `bismark` aligner **v2 `--combined_index` directional mode shipped** (#955) — opt-in, never-silent, **concordance-gated (NOT byte-identical)**: one both-strands Bowtie 2 pass over the combined CT+GA index (`Bisulfite_Genome/Combined/BS_combined`) instead of separate per-strand instances, recovering strand from RNAME-suffix×FLAG (OT→synthetic index 0, OB→1) into the byte-frozen output arm; faithful `chr:pos`+`>=`+Sylvain-Foret same-position tie resolution. **Single-end directional only** (non-dir/pbat/PE/HISAT2/minimap2/multicore hard-rejected); the faithful default path is untouched. **oxy directional gate PASS** vs the faithful 2-instance oracle (same binary, flag off) on real GRCh38 WGBS-SE at full 84M: oracle-unique-stays-unique 99.9008%; per-strand exact-POS OT 99.99491% / OB 99.99501%; `XM` OT 99.99583% / OB 99.99580%; `XR` 100% both strands; `XM`-among-POS-concordant 100% (no methylation divergence beyond placement). Non-directional = future phases.
- **2026-06-06** — `bismark` aligner **v1.x minimap2 SE backend + combined 10M gate — v1.x epic COMPLETE** (#950). minimap2 single-end byte-identical to Perl v0.25.1 + minimap2 2.31-r1302 (a pure wrapper: clean-slate `-a --MD --secondary=no -t 2 -x map-ont -K 250K` + positional `.mmi`; the merge/MAPQ/XM core reused unchanged — minimap2's `s2:i:` is ignored → `second_best=None`). PE-minimap2 hard-rejected (the Perl PE path is unfinished WIP — documented known gap). **Phase-5 combined 10M single-core gate: all 13 cells byte-identical** — HISAT2 SE+PE × {dir, non-dir, pbat}, minimap2 SE × {dir, non-dir, pbat} (worker-invariant `--parallel 8`==`1` @10M), Bowtie 2 SE/PE anchors, **+ mouse GRCm39 RRBS** (HISAT2 PE 11.73M rec + Bowtie 2 PE 12.56M rec); `ht2_pe_pbat` via R1↔R2 swap = real pbat (16.25M rec). The Bismark aligner now supports **Bowtie 2 + HISAT2 (SE+PE) + minimap2 (SE)**, all byte-identical to Perl driving the same pinned aligner.
- **2026-06-04** — `bismark` aligner **Phase 10 (full-scale real-data gate) PASSED — faithful aligner epic COMPLETE.** On oxy vs Perl v0.25.1 + Bowtie 2 2.5.5: content byte-identical at full real-data scale across WGBS SE (84.0M reads, 71.3M recs, 173 contigs), PE (84.0M pairs, 143.4M recs, 181 contigs), **mouse RRBS GRCm39** (46.7M pairs, 55.4M recs, 52 contigs), and **pbat** (R1↔R2 swap, 143.4M recs). Gate A (10M) = strict byte-identity vs Perl single-core + worker-invariance + *measured* multicore-multiset-invariance; Gate B (full) = content-multiset + report + count-reconciliation + RNAME-set + aux + perf; **V13** = the pre-existing Perl `--parallel 4` BAMs carry the same content md5 (four layouts converge). Dual code-review + plan-manager COMPLETE. The aligner is byte-faithful end-to-end: SE+PE, FastQ+FastA, all 3 library types, worker-invariant, full-scale-validated.
- **2026-06-03** — `bismark_methylation_extractor` **inline bedGraph/coverage2cytosine streaming** merged — `--bedGraph`/`--cytosine_report` now drive `bismark2bedGraph` + `coverage2cytosine` **in-process** (an in-memory tee feeds the bedGraph aggregator; c2c runs from the `.cov.gz`), replacing the Perl-subprocess scaffold. Byte-identical to Perl v0.25.1 across WGBS SE+PE × {bg, cr, cr_cx, cr_split, cutoff2, zero, ucsc} + RRBS `bg` at full scale (Phase H sub-gate 2, 16/16 oxy cells). `--CX` peak RSS comparable to Perl (~26–34 GB; inline is genome-bounded, not a regression at scale).
- **2026-06-03** — `bismark` aligner **Phase 9a (FastA, #942) + Phase 9b (order-preserving `--multicore`/`--parallel`)** — FastA input across all library types, plus worker-count-invariant file-level threading: `--parallel N` output byte-identical to `--parallel 1` and Perl single-core on oxy (6 cells SE/PE × {directional, non-directional, pbat}, 10k + 1M, incl. a non-divisible count). Full-scale real-data gate (Ph 10) remains.
- **2026-06-02** — `bismark` aligner **Phases 1–8** merged (#930) — SE + PE FastQ, **all 3 library types** (directional / non-directional / pbat); byte-identical to Perl v0.25.1 + Bowtie 2 2.5.5 on oxy (4 mode×layout cells, 10k + 1M reads/pairs). FastA + threading + full-scale gate (Phases 9–10) remain.
- **2026-06-02** — `coverage2cytosine` **v1.x niche modes** (`--gc`/`--nome-seq`/`--drach`/`--ffs`) merged (#934); 15-cell full-hg38 oxy gate byte-identical to Perl v0.25.1, tag `…beta.2`. **c2c port complete.**
- **2026-06-01** — `bismark2summary` ported (#932) — byte-identical project-level summary; the **last post-alignment module**.
- **2026-06-01** — `bismark2report` ported (#931) — byte-identical per-sample HTML report.
- **2026-06-01** — `filter_non_conversion` ported (#927) — byte-identical non-CpG / incomplete-conversion read filter.
- **2026-06-01** — `bam2nuc` ported (#922) — byte-identical mono/di-nucleotide coverage QC.
- **2026-06-01** — CI **`perl-oracle byte-identity`** gate added (#933) — runs the live Perl tools in CI and byte-compares.
- **2026-06-01** — `NOMe_filtering` ported (#928) — byte-identical standalone NOMe filter.
- **2026-05-31** — `bismark_genome_preparation` ported (#913) + `--genomic_composition` (#925) — byte-identical converted FASTA.
- **2026-05-31** — `coverage2cytosine` **v1.0** core merged (#892) — byte-identical CpG/CX report + `--merge_CpGs`; ~12× on the CpG-report path.
- **2026-05-30** — `bismark2bedGraph` ported (#893, epic #797) — byte-identical coverage/bedGraph; mimalloc perf (#915).
- **2026-05-30** — `methylation_consistency` ported (#896, epic #890) — byte-identical.
- **2026-05-26 → 05-29** — `bismark_methylation_extractor` ported (Phases A–G, #847–#883) — byte-identical at full scale, **~4.8×**; the ~16% runtime hot-spot.
- **2026-05-24 → 05-26** — `deduplicate_bismark` v1.2 UMI/RRBS modes (#819–#844) — byte-identical.
- _(earlier)_ — `bismark-io` shared library — the noodles BAM/SAM/CRAM foundation all consumers build on.
- ✅ **The faithful (Bowtie 2) `bismark` aligner port is COMPLETE** (all 10 phases, #948) — byte/content-identical to Perl v0.25.1 + Bowtie 2 2.5.5 across SE+PE, FastQ+FastA, all library types, full real-data scale (incl. mouse GRCm39 + pbat).
- ✅ **`bismark` aligner v1.x COMPLETE — HISAT2 (SE+PE) + minimap2 (SE)** (epic `plans/06052026_bismark-aligner-v1x/`, #949 + #950). Both backends byte-identical to Perl v0.25.1 driving the same pinned aligner; the Phase-5 combined 10M gate confirmed all 13 cells (3 backends × library types + mouse GRCm39). The Bismark aligner now offers all three engines.
- 🚧 **In progress: combined-index v2.x — paired-end + HISAT2** (epic `plans/06102026_combined-index-v2x/`) — extends the shipped SE + Bowtie 2 combined-index (#955–959) to **paired-end** and the **HISAT2** backend, concordance-gated, parallel model (a) the default. **Shipped:** HISAT2-combined SE (#967) + PE-combined Bowtie 2 directional (#969) + non-directional (#970). **Remaining:** PE pbat (Phase 4) / PE-HISAT2 (Phase 5). PE low-RAM variants (Phase 6) are **data-gated** on the measured PE non-dir model-(a) peak RSS (**15.71 GB / 2 indices co-resident**, #970) — a PE sequential variant would cut ~−50% (as SE did), to build only if that ceiling is a concern. **minimap2-combined is deferred to the rammap / long-read track** (architecturally mismatched + no PE oracle).
